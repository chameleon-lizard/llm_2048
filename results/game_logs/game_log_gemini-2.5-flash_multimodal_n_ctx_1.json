Shifting **UP** also consolidates tiles.\n\nLet's compare LEFT and UP for future potential:\n*   **LEFT:** [8, 2, _, _], [_, _, _, _], [2, 2, _, _], [_, _, _, _]. This creates a pair of 2s on the second row.\n*   **UP:** [8, 2, _, 2], [2, _, _, _], [_, _, _, _], [_, _, _, _]. This spreads the 2s out more.\n\nThe **LEFT** move creates a merge opportunity for the two '2's on the third row, should a left shift be performed again or if another '2' appears next to them. This seems like a better move to set up future merges.\n\nFINAL_RESPONSE: LEFT"

Both UP and LEFT consolidate tiles.

However, the common strategy is to try and consolidate tiles to one side or a corner. If we want to keep the highest tile (8) in the top-left corner, then moving LEFT is better as it keeps the 8 there and creates another 8 next to it. If we want to move towards the right, then RIGHT is better.\n\nGiven the initial state with a high tile (8) in the top-left, a LEFT move seems to align better with a corner-strategy, as it keeps the 8 in place and potentially builds on it.\n\nLet's confirm the LEFT move one more time:\nRow 0: `[8, 4, 4, _]`\n1. Non-empty tiles: `[8, 4, 4]`\n2. Shift all to the left: `[8, 4, 4, _]`\n3. Merge from left to right:\n   * (0,0) is 8. No tile to its right to merge with.\n   * (0,1) is 4. (0,2) is 4. They merge to 8. (0,1) becomes 8. (0,2) becomes empty.\n   * Now the row is `[8, 8, _, _]`\n4. Shift again to fill gaps: `[8, 8, _, _]`\n\nThis is correct. Moving LEFT results in `[8, 8, _, _]` which is excellent for a future merge to 16.\n\nFINAL_RESPONSE: LEFT"
