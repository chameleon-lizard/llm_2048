They won\u2019t merge, since they are in different columns.  \n- **DOWN**: both the 2\u2019s move downward. One goes to the bottom of column 1, the other to the bottom of column 2. No merge either.  \n- **LEFT**: the top 2 stays in the same spot; the second 2 in row 2 moves to the left (to column 1). Now we have a 2 at (1,1) and another at (2,1), vertically stacked, still unable to merge since merges occur along the direction of movement (horizontal move merges horizontally adjacent tiles, not vertical ones).  \n- **RIGHT**: the first 2 moves from (1,1) \u2192 (1,4); the second 2 moves from (2,2) \u2192 (2,4). No merges yet, but they are now aligned vertically on the right side, setting up potential merges if we later move **UP** or **DOWN**.\n\nStrategically, moving **RIGHT** gives us a tidier corner alignment (often a standard 2048 tactic is to build up in one corner), and maximizes empty space for new tiles.\n\nFINAL_RESPONSE: RIGHT"
