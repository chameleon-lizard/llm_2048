Result: [-, -, 8, 8, 16, 4]? No that's 6 positions. In 2048, [4, 8, 16, 4] \u2192 [4, 8, 16, 4] (can't merge, already at right)\n\nActually the two 4s can't merge because they're separated.

Only the two 4s can merge: [**8**, 8, 16, -] then [**16**, 16, -] then [**32**, -, -, -]\nWait, merges happen once per move: [4, 8, 16, 4] \u2192 first compress left [4, 8, 16, 4], then merge adjacent: only the 4s aren't adjacent! So \u2192 [4, 8, 16, 4, -]\n\nLet me reconsider properly: In one LEFT move, tiles slide left and **like values merge once**:\n[4, 8, 16, 4] \u2192 The 4s are at positions 0 and 3.

No, only adjacent merge.\n[4, 2, 8, 4] \u2192 slides down (already down) \u2192 checks adjacent: 8 and 4 are adjacent \u2192 [-, 4, 2, **12**]? No, 8+4=12 but they don't merge (different values).\nActually the two 4s at positions 0 and 3 \u2192 after sliding [-, -, 4, 2, 8, 4]? That's 6 positions again.\n\nIn a 4x4 grid column: [4, 2, 8, 4] moving down means they're already at bottom. No movement or merges.\n- **Minimal effect**\n\n**UP:**\n- Column 0: [-, -, -, 4] \u2192 [4, -, -, -]\n- Column 1: [-, -, 32, 8] \u2192 [32, 8, -, -]\n- Column 2: [2, 4, 64, 16] \u2192 [2, 4, 64, 16] or [2, 4, 64, 16] (no merges)\n- Column 3: [4, 2, 8, 4] \u2192 [**8**, 2, 8, -] or [4, 2, 8, 4] \u2192 [4, 2, 8, 4]\n\nLet me reconsider column 3 UP: [4, 2, 8, 4] \u2192 slide up [4, 2, 8, 4, -, -, -]? No, it's [4, 2, 8, 4] in 4 positions. Merge check: no adjacent matches. Result: [4, 2, 8, 4, -, -, -]... \n\nI need to think about this correctly for a 4-row column:\nPosition 0 (top): 4\nPosition 1: 2  \nPosition 2: 8\nPosition 3 (bottom): 4\n\nMoving UP: everything slides up (already up), then adjacent pairs merge. The two 4s aren't adjacent. **No merges**.\n\nGiven the analysis, **LEFT** seems best to:\n1. Consolidate tiles to the left\n2. Create space on the right for new tiles\n3.
